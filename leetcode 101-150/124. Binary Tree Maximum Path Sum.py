"""
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem,
a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.
